Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections.

The project HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online website for a conference. You should follow the given design of the website, but you must personalize the content.

For this project I personalize the content for a Workshop E-commerce, it is about building your own site eCommerce and is oriented to entrepreneurs or people with business, this conference will be located on the city of Cusco in Peru and will be organized by Cusco Solutions that is a Peruvian company.
