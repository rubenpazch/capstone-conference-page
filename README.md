# Building a catstone project for a conference page

## Project specifications

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

+ It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
+ You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.

The project you are going to build for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online website for a conference. You should follow the given design of the website, but you must personalise the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course. It's very important the you personalise your project, so that you have something unique in your portfolio to share with potential employers during your job search.
